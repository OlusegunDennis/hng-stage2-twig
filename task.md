Hey Qwen, please give me a full report of the current ticket-app-twig project structure after all your fixes, including:

All top-level files (like server.js, package.json, Dockerfile).

Directories and their contents (views/, public/, etc.).

Confirmation that views/ contains all Twig templates and public/ contains all static assets.

Confirmation that there are no PHP files or composer.json remaining.

Any notes on whether the project is ready to push to GitHub and deploy to Railway.
