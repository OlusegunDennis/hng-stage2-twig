Qwen, please update the remaining files for Railway deployment:

Ensure all Twig templates are in the templates/ folder with correct names matching server.js routes (landing, auth/login, auth/signup, dashboard, tickets/list, tickets/create, tickets/edit, 404).

Make sure all static assets (CSS, JS, images, SVGs) are in public/ and all <link>, <script>, <img> references in Twig use root-relative paths (/css/..., /js/..., /images/...).

Update the ticket delete functionality on the client-side to use POST /tickets/delete/:id via AJAX instead of DELETE method.

Verify all pages render properly, routes match Twig files, and the 404 page displays for invalid routes.
